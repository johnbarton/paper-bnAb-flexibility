See the iPython notebook `analysis.ipynb` for details on the affinity maturation simulations. Running this notebook requires the Python packages [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

Matlab data and scripts for the molecular dynamics analysis are located in the `molecular_dynamics/` folder. See the `molecular_dynamics/README.md` for details.
